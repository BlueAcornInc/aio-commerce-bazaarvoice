# Local setup
## Without Magento Adobe Commerce: 
The easiest way to develop your code and test it. You can work assuming your Admin SDK menu inside Adobe Commerce works and loads the form. You do not need to run this inside the Commerce container.

First generate the encryption keys. In your terminal in root directory of this app run:

`aio auth:login`

`aio app use`

Encryption Key:

`openssl rand -hex 32`

IV Key:

`openssl rand -hex 16`

Put these in the .env file. 

Run the local test of your app:
`aio app run`

This deploys the runtime functions in Adobe cloud and the local form instance consumes it. 

Visit https://localhost:9080
to see the form in action.

## With Adobe Commerce

You need the following prerequisites to test on local:

- https://localhost:8443 AC instance up and running using the evergreen repo
- Your app builder repo must be inside the AC root codebase.
- Admin SDK module installed in AC composer.json the following line: `"magento/commerce-backend-sdk": "2.2.0 as 1.4.1",`
- IMS auth on your local AC instance.

## IMS Faking
<https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/extensibility/admin-ui-sdk/configuration/>
get node server snippet from there and paste it inside a random directory in your AC container. This must be done inside AC php container. Run `node server.js` after generating key/cert following instructions in that link above.

This short circuits the ims authorization and serves you the aio app. In your aio app dir,

## Next Steps
Shell into magento container inside your aio app dir and set up aio:\
`npm install -g @adobe/aio-cli`\
Navigate to your AIO app repo codebase (inside the AC codebase as mentioned before)
Run`aio auth:login`. Once installed make sure you have a project workspace already in [Adobe console developer (ACD) ](https://developer.adobe.com/console/projects/) set up.

Go into your builder project workspace and select "Download All" to get the json at the top right of ACD.
save this as `config.json` in your aio app dir.  Run `aio app use config.json` to load the profile. To launch your app

Once you got to this stage, and you still have `server.js` running:
- Run `aio app dev`
- Go to admin AC admin area:
  Stores -> Configuration Adobe Services -> Admin UI SDK

**General configuration**
Enable Admin UI SDK: Yes
(Enable the AdobeAdminims module to use the Admin UI SDK.)

**Testing**
Enable testing: Yes
Local Server Base URL: https://localhost:9090/
Mock AdobeAdminIms Module: Yes

- Save
- Click "Refresh Integrations" in that admin area

This registers the menu and you should see it now after admin refresh. But the form wont load. to do that:

## Backend Form

- Cancel out of the aio app dev command currently running,  It's already registered and does not need to run all the time.
  If you have 2 apps running, 1 of them being Admin SDK form and 1 of them being another application ( reference your `app.config.yaml` file of your AIO app, then you need to run `aio app run -e [application_name]` to deploy the endpoints or runtime functions to adobe before your form can work completely if it has dependencies on it. You will see message in terminal saying it was successfully deployed. now terminate that command with ctrl+c.
- Run `aio app run -e commerce/backend-ui/1`
-  Go back to Magento admin, refresh, and you should see the form load in the space now.
